<h2 id="hi">Hi!</h2>
<p>I’m Jagoda and this is my little blog, created for my personal therapy and your entertainment.
I’m an open source enthusiast and Rust advocate, a full-stack dev, a self-proclaimed artist, and a full-time tinkerer.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h3 id="i-m-currently-working-on">I’m currently working on:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Finding a job</em></strong> <br />
The last contract ended pretty abruptly when a potential client didn’t get funding and suddenly there was no work for me
to do anymore. <em>(So I’m open for work and can start immediately,
contact me if you have some interesting project I can help with!)</em></li>
<li><strong>Ratatui v0.30 release</strong> <br />
This will be the biggest release since forking tui-rs and I’m really excited about it!
I took part in making Ratatui no-std compatible which I hope will result in it being useful in many new places.</li>
<li><strong>Mousefood v0.3 release</strong> <br />
This release most importantly will make use of no-std compatibility of Ratatui 0.30, which will expand its usages
beyond esp32 <em>(It already runs on PSP!)</em></li>
<li><strong>This blog</strong> <br />
Hi! :D</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ideas-in-early-stages-that-i-want-to-tackle-this-year">Ideas in early stages, that I want to tackle this year:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rust VGA driver for esp32</strong> <br />
I have this crazy idea to give a talk which is presented directly from a microcontroller,
this is essential to make it possible.</li>
<li><strong>Kloshel programming language</strong> <br />
A weird LISP dialect and interpreter written in Rust. I haven’t open-sourced it yet, mostly an experiment.</li>
<li><strong>Get back into self-hosting and painting</strong> <br />
This obviously first requires finding a job.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-this-blog">What is this blog?</h2>
<p>As my 2025 resolution, I decided to start living instead of waiting for perfect conditions. This blog is a partial,
public, and sometimes non-obvious diary of how I’m doing, where I post relevant thoughts and things I’m personally
proud of—things that may be of interest to you, the reader. The main topics should be open source and Rust,
but I won’t necessarily limit myself to those and may include anything I feel like yapping about.</p>
<p>I’ve loved the idea of open source for years, but since software development is my job, it was insanely hard for me to
justify "working for free." FOSDEM 2025 was a turning point for me: I joined because I wanted to be part of this
amazing community and stayed for the joy of being able to work on anything that interests me. In April 2025,
I created Mousefood and became a maintainer of Ratatui in June.</p>
<p>To both share what interests me and to fight my anxiety, I decided to start giving talks. I gave a lightning talk,
"Ratatui na sterydach," at PIWO 2025 and a full-length talk, "Ratatui - Are We Embedded Yet?" at Rust Gdańsk #9 and
Rust Poland x Poznań meetups. I hope to do more talks in the future,
and presenting at FOSDEM is one of my personal goals.</p>

<h2 id="art">Art</h2>
<p>During the pandemic, I decided to start doing art as a hobby and mostly practiced painting still lives.
I then studied graphic design (while still studying computer science and working as a web dev, which was rough...).
I dropped out, as I mostly enjoyed painting but chose graphic design because it "made more sense" - a hard lesson.
It was also a tough time in my life and I had to take care of other things...</p>
<p>I really hope to get back to painting in 2025.</p>

<h2 id="tinkering">Tinkering</h2>
<p>While at university, I created many custom Eurorack modules and cases. I hope to finally make a post about them.</p>

<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>Since I built a custom modular synth... I also made some music.
I don’t really publish much though (as I don’t really finish much either).</p>
